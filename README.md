## Description
This application is deployed on the following link
- https://shah-hoque.github.io/password-generator/

This application creates a password based on the following user input options:
- The requested length of the password (between 10 and 64 characters)
- The option to include capital letters
- The option to include numbers
- The option to include special characters

The benefits of this application:
- Users can create complicated passwords at ease with the desired length and character types
- A randomised generator can produce a more random result than randomly typing keys
- The application provides the option to automatically copy the result to your clipboard

## Installation
There are no prerequisites required to run this application on a modern web browser.

The password generator will not produce a memorable password therefore the user is expected to copy and paste the result in a secured place. 
- The recommended path would be to use a popular password manager to save the result

## Usage
The application is responsive, therefore, it can be used on a range of devices.

Required inputs from the user:
- The following inputs are required otherwise the application will not produce a result for the user. An error message will request the user to correct their input.
    - A number between 10 and 64
    - The form will only input a number, not text
    - At least one optional switch must be turned on

How to take the generated password:
- The user can either manually highlight and copy the result 
- The user can click on the icon on the bottom right that will automatically copy the result to their clipboard

## Application deployed
